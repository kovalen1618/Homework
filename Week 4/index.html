    <h1>Single-Origin Coffee</h1>
    <p>
      Coffee comes from many different places - but most on the grocery shelf tend to be a blend
      of origins from around the world. That's not to say these coffees taste awful, but there are
      certain characteristics that shine through in coffees from specific farms in specific countries -
      not to mention the idea of keeping local coffee farmers supported for their hard work.

    <h3>My Favorite Coffees</h3>
    <p>Here is a list of single-origin coffees that I have found to be exceptional ranked highest to lowest:</p>
    <div id="wrapper">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/products/indonesia-bies-penantan" class="highlight">Bies Panantan,
            Indonesia</a> - a medium roast with notes of dark chocolate and balanced by tropical fruit acidity. Farmed
          by a dedicated women-led cooperative on the northern-side of Sumatra.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.kuvacoffee.com/shop/qre93s48v8ydb08hdqzjahq5n0bdjl" class="highlight">Hueheutenango,
            Guatemala</a> - an STL local bagger working with Guatemala farmers to disperse a complex and creamy coffee
          with notes of raspberry, cherry, and caramel. Farmed in the western highlands of Guatemala.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://atlascoffeeclub.com/" class="highlight">Nueva Segovia, Nicaragua</a> - while this particular
          bagger doesn't sell this coffee on demand, and instead curate different batches for each month, this
          particular brew was exceptional. Hailing from volcanic rich soil in Nicaragua - this medium roast contained
          notes of butter, black cherry, and toffee.
        </li>
      </ol>
